## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to our security team at [security@brainsprint.com](mailto:security@brainsprint.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. Work to validate the reported issue
3. Work on a fix (if needed)
4. Release a security update when appropriate
5. Notify you when the vulnerability has been resolved

## Public Notification

When a security issue is reported, we will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible. Once a fix is available, we will:

1. Create a new release with the security fix
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with security-related information
3. Notify users through appropriate channels

## Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories under the BrainSprint organization that are actively maintained.

## Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with your security research, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document.
